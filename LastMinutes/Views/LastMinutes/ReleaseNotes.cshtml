                    <li>Opened extra time frames for public use, such as:

                    <li>There is now a 'News' feature on the landing & pending pages to provide information on the status of the app.</li>
                    <li>The cooldown timer has been reduced to six hours.</li>
                    <li>I have changed the queue processing so that Spotify searches for runtimes before Deezer. This will result in a less accurate result as the Deezer grabber is far more accurate than the Spotify one. This is a temporary measure while my connection to the Deezer API is volatile.  I will remove all cached tracks from Spotify from this point onward when the issue is resolved.</li>
